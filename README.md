# PR Label Manager

A comprehensive GitHub Action that automatically manages PR labels and status based on various events and conditions. This action provides intelligent labeling for the entire PR lifecycle from draft to production deployment.

## Features

### üè∑Ô∏è Automatic Label Management

- **Draft PRs**: Automatically adds `Status: Draft` for draft pull requests
- **Feature Classification**: Detects and labels `Feature: Base` and `Feature: Part` PRs
- **Branch-Based Labels**: Auto-detects `hotfix/`, `fix/`, and `rc/` branches with appropriate labels
- **Content-Based Labels**: Intelligently detects breaking changes, documentation, refactoring, performance, and security changes
- **Review Status**: Manages `Code review: In progress`, `Code review: Request Changes`, and `Code review: Approved` labels
- **Deployment Tracking**: Tracks staging and production deployments with appropriate labels
- **Conflict Detection**: Monitors and labels PRs with merge conflicts
- **Lifecycle Management**: Handles merged, abandoned, and ready-for-review states
- **Command-Based Labels**: Responds to comment commands like `!action_required`, `!urgent`, `!breaking`, `!security`

### üîÑ Event-Driven Automation

- **Pull Request Events**: Responds to opened, closed, synchronized, and draft conversion events
- **Review Events**: Handles review submissions, approvals, and change requests
- **Push Events**: Tracks deployments to staging and production branches
- **Scheduled Checks**: Periodic monitoring for abandoned PRs and merge conflicts

### üé® Smart Label Creation

- **Auto-Creation**: Automatically creates missing labels with appropriate colors
- **Color Coding**: Uses semantic colors for different label types
- **Consistent Naming**: Enforces consistent label naming across repositories

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/pr-manager.yml`) in your repository:

```yaml

  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted, dismissed]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  push:
    branches: [main, staging]
  schedule:
    # Run every hour to check for abandoned PRs and merge conflicts
    - cron: '0 * * * *'

jobs:
  pr-manager:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write

  pull_request:
  pull_request_review:
  push:
    branches: [main, staging]

jobs:
  pr-manager:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

### Enterprise Repository with Custom Branches

```yaml
name: PR Label Manager

on:
  pull_request:
  pull_request_review:
  push:
    branches: [master, develop, staging]

jobs:
  pr-manager:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Labels not being created**: Ensure the token has `issues: write` permission
2. **Review events not triggering**: Make sure the workflow includes `pull_request_review` events
3. **Scheduled checks not running**: Verify the cron schedule is valid and the repository has activity
